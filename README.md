## Introduction 

Welcome to my first project. The website is about a new wrestling bar in the heart of London. The website is a simple 3 tab url which will tell the user the information they need. That would be About/Menu and Contact me page.

I, as a big fan of wrestling thought this would be the perfect opportunity to make my first project wrestling based.

### 2.User Experience

- I have realised for a while, London does not have many wrestling themed venus considering its a   massive hub for global wrestling companies. So this bar is perfect for the following people:

- wrestling fans who want to watch it with friends/family
- casual wrestling fans who want a fun spontanous night out
- People who like dressing up and gamers
- First dates!

### Aims
- In this project, I will build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far.

- Data is presented to help users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service in which   they   are interested. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.

- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- The site needs to provide the information needs when visiting the website ( About, Menu and contact details)
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

### Client Goals

- The site needs to be easily accessible.
- The navigation menu needs to be simple to use on a range of devices, including desktop, tablet and mobile.
- Manoeuvring around the site should be simple and straightforward.
- The site should be informative and all the text should be easy to read.
- The images should be clear and not stretched or squashed.

### First Time Visitors
- I want it to be easy to understand how to navigate throughout the site.
- I want the content to be easily read and understandable.

### Returning User
- To gather information for projects.
- To recommend the site to friends and family.
- To get in contact with us

### Design

### Color Scheme
The colours I have used are Burleywood and black. Both fitting colours which would suit the backgrounds on all three pages.

I feel like Burleywood suits the whole website, giving it the colour to attract the user at first glance.

Smokey background for the contact page, so its very easy to see the address and map of where the location is held

### Features
1. Background color of menu bar and foreground color were chosen considering the contrast between background and foreground colours
2. Social media links (for facebook, Linkden, Twitter and Youtube) are placed at the bottom of the each page in the footer. All the links will open in a new tab.
3. Quick information the user needs ( About, Menu and Openings)

### Hover
1. Tells the user the location of the mouse whilst navigating the menu.
2. Helps the user not lose their place.

### Technologies Used

1. HTML5
The project uses HyperText Markup Language.

2. CSS3
The project uses Cascading Style Sheets.

3. Chrome
The project uses Chrome to debug and test the source code using HTML5.

4. Balsamiq
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

5. Google Fonts
Google fonts were used to import the "Lato/Sans-Sarif" font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

6. GitHub
GitHub was used to store the project's code after being pushed from Gitpush.

7.  Google Developer Tools
I make use of google developer tools (Chrome DevTools) as debugging tools. Using this tool i inspect for every elements that I added in HTML and CSS style. Once I was happy with, I copy the CSS style code from Chrome DevTools and paste in my CSS style sheet.

## 3. Testing with Tools

### Google Developer Tools
I tested my website using Google Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse feature, and received the results below for all 3 pages:

- Home

### Responsive Tools

### W3C Validator Tools

 ### Solved Bugs
 - I had a warning on my HTML Index page. Here it is below. After speaking to student support I realised that section does not need a heading, so it would be ok to leave it whilst explaining on my readme the situation.
