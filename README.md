## Introduction 

Welcome to my first project. This project is based on wrestling, which is something I watch and enjoy on a weely basis.  I decided to build a website for a wrestling themed bar in the heart of London.

### 3.USER EXPERIENCE

### Aims
- In this project, I will build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far.

- Data is presented to help users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service in which   they   are interested. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.

- The site needs to be easy to use
- Moving the mouse around the site needs to be simple
- The site needs to provide the information needs when visiting the website ( About, Menu and contact details)
- Images that show what the bar looks like inside and the layout 

### CLIENT GOALS
- The site needs to be easily accessible.
- The navigation menu needs to be simple to use on a range of devices, including desktop, tablet and      mobile.
- Manoeuvring around the site should be simple and straightforward.
- The site should be informative and all the text should be easy to read.
- The images should be clear and not stretched or squashed.

## FIRST TIME VISITORS
- I want it to be easy to understand how to navigate throughout the site.
- I want the content to be easily read and understandable.

## RETURNING USER
- To gather information for projects.
- To recommend the site to friends and family.
- To get in contact with us

### Design

### COLOR SCHEME
The colours I have used are Burleywood and black. Both fitting colours which would suit the backgrounds on all three pages.

I feel like Burleywood suits the whole website, giving it the colour to attract the user at first glance.

[Here is a link to my main color](https://www.color-name.com/burlywood.color)
